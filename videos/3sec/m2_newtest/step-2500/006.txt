On a tiled kitchen floor with a low wooden counter along the left, a single slice of bread sits on a ceramic plate. Jerry, the brown mouse, scurries from beneath the counter toward the plate while Tom, the blue-gray cat, steps in from the right doorway. Their positions place them within a foot of each other; Jerry is near the plate and Tom pauses with his body angled slightly toward him.
