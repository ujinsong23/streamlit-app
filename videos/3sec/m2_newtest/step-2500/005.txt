A room with a patterned floor and a high, clear window revealing daylight in the background contains a low metal table situated slightly off-center. A square piece of yellow cheese rests on the table. Jerry, the brown mouse, is seen running from the left toward the cheese, and Tom, the blue-gray cat, enters from the right with one paw raised in a reaching gesture.
