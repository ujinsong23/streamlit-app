In an attic with exposed wooden beams, faded floorboards, and several scattered cardboard boxes, an old wooden trunk sits positioned in the center. Jerry, the brown mouse, emerges from a small hole in the insulation along the left wall and runs toward the trunk across a dusty plank. At the same time, Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears from behind a stack of boxes near the attic door, moving slowly toward the trunk.
