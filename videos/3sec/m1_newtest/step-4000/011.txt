A rustic red barn and weathered wooden fence form the backdrop. Tom, the blue-gray cat, tiptoes near a faded tractor parked beside a haystack. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out from behind the haystack with wide eyes and twitching whiskers. Tom, the blue-gray cat, lifts a right paw as if preparing to pounce, while Jerry, the brown mouse, darts slightly away.
