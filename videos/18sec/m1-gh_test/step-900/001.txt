A rectangular red couch is fixed against the back wall, clearly visible in the background. In the center of the room, a white pillow rests on the floor beneath Tom, the blue-gray cat, who has just awakened.

The kitchen features a uniformly painted blue wall and a light brown floor tiled evenly across the space. In the kitchen at the refrigerator, the camera shifts to a close-up view centered on Tom, the blue-gray cat, as he reaches the refrigerator door.

In the kitchen, a blue wall and tiled light brown floor define the area. The refrigerator on the right side remains open, outlining its interior structure with evenly spaced shelving. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands beside the open refrigerator, holding the can in the right paw. With a deliberate movement, Tom uses the paw to extract Jerry, the brown mouse, from the can. Following the extraction, Tom, the blue-gray cat, places Jerry, the brown mouse, back inside the can and then moves toward the refrigerator door. Tomâ€™s motion culminates in shutting the refrigerator door with a firm movement, causing the door panel to swing closed.<end_scene>
