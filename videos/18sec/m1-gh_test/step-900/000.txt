Inside the mouse hole, the wall is painted light blue and the floor is made of wood with a clear grain pattern. A small framed picture of a flower hangs on the wall, and a bed covered with a yellow blanket is placed against the left wall. The camera pans from the left side toward the right, showing the entrance of the mouse hole and the path leading to the bed. Jerry, the brown mouse, appears at the doorway and walks slowly toward the bed with a visibly tired expression.

Inside the mouse hole, a light blue wall and a wooden floor establish the space. Against the left wall, a bed covered with a yellow blanket is positioned, and a small framed picture of a flower hangs on the wall above. The camera moves slowly to the left as Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the bed. A previously unseen small bedside table with a lamp becomes visible next to the bed. Jerry, the brown mouse, climbs up onto the bed, and settles beneath the yellow blanket, opening his mouth with a large yawn.

Inside the mouse hole, the light blue wall and the wooden floor remain the dominant visual elements of the room. A bed covered with a yellow blanket is centrally located, and a small bedside table with a lamp sits next to the bed. Jerry, the brown mouse, lies on the bed, and reaches out to switch off the lamp on the bedside table, causing the illumination in the room to decrease. Jerry, the brown mouse, then closes his eyes and falls asleep.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The corridor features a uniform yellow wall and a smooth brown floor. At the center of the wall, a small mouse hole is visible. On the right side of the wall, a small bell is hung. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands next to the mouse hole. His face shows a curious expression, and his ears tilt slightly, as if he is intently listening to a sound coming from inside the mouse hole.

The corridor, with its uniform yellow wall and smooth brown floor, continues to set the stage. Along the right side of the wall, the small bell remains hung. Tom, the blue-gray cat, approaches the bell and uses one of his paws to grasp it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, shakes the bell, producing a metallic sound that briefly echoes through the space. His expression is joyful and alert during the action.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Back inside the mouse hole, the interior is defined by a light blue wall and a wooden floor with a visible grain. However, the room appears disturbed by slight vibrations. These cause small objects, such as the framed picture of a flower and the bedside table, to shift subtly. Positioned on the left side of the room, the bed covered with a yellow blanket now serves as the platform for Jerry, the brown mouse. Jerry, who was previously asleep, wakes abruptly, and his face registers an upset expression as he reacts to the noise from outside.
