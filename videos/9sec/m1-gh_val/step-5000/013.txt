Against a yellow wall with vertical wood panels, a brown door with a yellow doorknob sits slightly ajar, revealing a blue interior that stands on a dark gray flooring. A disorderly line of five or more floppy-eared white puppies scurry rambunctiously out the door, darting off-frame to the left. Amid the chaos, one puppy is tossed into the air, landing on its back with its body straight as it bounces once on the floor. It quickly sits up, looking to the left with one paw bracing the floor for support, then tumbles into an all-fours position and scrambles after the other puppies.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A dark purple flooring extends across the screen with a green wall to the left which meets a brick wall at the center and extends to the right. There's a brown litterbox and white pillow on it. On the floor is a red bowl with six puppies feeding from it. Tom, the blue-gray cat and Jerry, the brown mouse are watching from opposite sides of the bowl. Suddenly, another white puppy comes from the right side of the screen and joins the others.

A dark grey floor extends across the screen, with a green wooden wall to the left and a red brick wall meeting at the center. A brown carton box with white pillows is positioned at the edge of the green wall. In the center, a group of white puppies eagerly eat from a red bowl. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands nearby watching, while Jerry, the brown mouse, observes from the other side. After a few moments, Tom rests one of his hands on the green wall, while Jerry does the same on the brown carton box.
