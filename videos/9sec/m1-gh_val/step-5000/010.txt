The sky is painted in warm hues of orange and pink as the sun sets, with scattered clouds drifting across the horizon. In the center of the frame, a small gray duck flaps its wings while flying closely behind its mother, a larger gray duck. The wind ruffles their feathers as they soar gracefully through the sky. The small gray duck glances downward, spotting familiar figures far below. With a gentle wave of its tiny wing, it bids farewell to those watching from the ground. The camera follows the ducks, capturing their movement against the glowing sky as they fly.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The scene is set outdoors with a light blue sky filled with numerous small birds flying in formation. Wide green grass sits in front of the sky, and Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in the center of the frame on the grass holding a blue object. Jerry faces toward the left, looking up at the birds. He salutes, smiles, and waves at the flock of birds flying above him in the light blue sky. He then puts the light blue object to his lips and blows it to get the birds' attention, and a dark dim circular shape appears, showing the end of the scene.
