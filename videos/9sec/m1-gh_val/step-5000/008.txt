A dark floor stretches across the scene with a dark wall behind it and a wooden table in front of it, with an opening to a green room off to the side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, mischievously snakes his elongated body around the wall's opening with furrowed brows and a smile. His back legs walk around the opening and condense back into his body, to where he assumes a pouncing position. The camera pans left as he starts carefully crawling onto the table's box stretcher.

A wide, black floor stretches across the scene with a green wall and a dark wooden table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, intently lays on the table's box stretcher with heavily furrowed brows and his mouth tightly shut. The camera pans left as Tom carefully crawls on the box stretcher. He stands up on the hill of the stretcher, raises his arms to the side, and then slides down to the other foot of the table as he flails his arms in the air. He grabs onto the leg of the table.

The scene is in shadows, with a dark floor extending to a yellow wall siding and a green wall. The main black, leg of a large table is on the left, with a support beam near the bottom going to the right, and the table top also going to the right. The blue-gray cat, Tom is sitting on the support bean, with his shoulder against the leg, an angry look on his face. The camera pans to the left and the blue-gray cat, Tom then opens his mouth, rears back and attack leaps off screen.
