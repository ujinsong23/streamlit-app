The scene features a lake in the foreground with greenish water. On the shore, there are a few patches of green grass and bushes, along with a large tree trunk standing in the center of the frame. A fallen tree lies horizontally at the bottom of the frame. A small flock of five yellow ducklings is swimming from right to left, with the last duckling seemingly struggling to keep up, using its tiny wings to paddle forward.

The scene is a close-up of a portion of a lake with blue waters. Tall grasses are growing out of the water in the background. There are three yellow ducklings in a straight line headed left. The first two are paddling forward with their eyes closed. The third duckling in line is swimming with its hands in breaststroke. It turns its body so it's lying on the water with its back and his hands behind his head. He smiles a big smile and wades with its webbed feet in the water to keep it moving.

A scene in a pond with many plants above the water on the upper side. Three yellow ducks are swimming to the left, with the two ducks in front swimming as usual with happy faces and closed eyes, while the duck at the very back is swimming while lying down by moving its legs and both hands behind its head, then it waves its left hand.
