A grass field is spread across the screen set against a white fence. On the grass, there is Spike, the gray dog, and a small gray dog ​​next to Spike, both of whom are sleeping. Jerry, the brown mouse, who is between Spike and the gray dog, is holding a white paper with 'DO NOT DISTURB' written on it in red and hanging it on Spike, the gray dog's left ear. After making sure the paper is successfully hung, Jerry, the brown mouse, is getting ready to sleep between Spike and the gray dog.

The scene is on the flat green grass in the yard. A wooden fence is in the background. A leafy plant is partially visible on the right side. On the left side, Spike, the gray bulldog, is sleeping with a slight smile on his face. He is facing center towards the right. Next to Spike, on his left side, is Jerry, the brown mouse, who eases himself in, breathes deeply, and lies down to sleep. Next to Jerry, on his left, is Tyke, the gray bulldog puppy. Spike and Tyke are both wearing identical spiked red dog collars. On Spike's left ear hangs a note that says "DO NOT DISTURB."

A spot of dark brown soil with some grass around it spans the bottom of the screen, set against a white wooden fence. A small green bush can be partly seen on the right side of the screen. There are two grey bulldogs with red spiked collars lying down sleeping with their eyes closed, smiling. The bulldog on the left is big and full grown, the bulldog on the right is a puppy that is smaller. In between them is Jerry, the brown mouse also sleeping with his eyes closed and smiling. There is a "DO NOT DISTURB" sign in the middle hanging on the big bulldogs ear. The scene transitions to a solid black with a circle closing in on Jerry.
