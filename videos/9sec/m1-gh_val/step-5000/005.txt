A green field with red and white flowers and trees stretches across the screen. Tied on the trees is a blue stitched hammock with white strings on which to the left lies Spike, the gray dog on his back. Spike has placed his hands to the side with the palms meeting at the back of his head. To the right lies Jerry, the small brown mouse with a posture to Spike. At the center, next to the hammock stands Tom, the blue-gray cat, with two bandages, one on his right thigh and the other close to the right ear. Tom holds a yellow stick on whose end is a red leaf, which he swings to blow air towards Jerry. Spike is swinging his right leg just behind Tom and at one time kicks Tom on the back.

An outdoor scene with a bright blue sky and lush green grass. In the distance, a light gray wall stretches across the background. On the right side, a green tree with a wide canopy stands over a yellow table. In the center of the frame, a blue hammock is strung up. Jerry, the brown mouse, is sound asleep on it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands nearby, holding a red fan with a yellow handle. Tom has two bandages on his body and is fanning Jerry. Every now and then, someone behind Tom gives him a swift kick, making him jump in fear.

Blue skies and a green garden set the scene, with a white wall in the background. A blue hammock with white trims occupies most of the frame, its strings visible on the right. In the bottom right corner, a partially visible yellow table is present. Jerry, the brown mouse, is lying on the right side of the hammock with his hands behind his head, legs spread wide, and a satisfied smile on his face. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in the center, facing right toward Jerry. His body is covered in bandages, including his head and waist. He has raised eyebrows, an open mouth, and wide eyes, showing a worried expression. Holding a yellow stick with a red leaf at the end, he fans Jerry with both hands. On the left side, only the legs of the gray dog, Spike, are visible, with one leg swinging and kicking Tom as he continues to fan Jerry.
