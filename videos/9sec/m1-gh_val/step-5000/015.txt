A green billiard table with a yellow border stretches across the screen, set against a gradient wall. To the right, six billiard balls are lined up in order—white, blue, green, black, orange, and yellow—while another white ball sits slightly apart from the group. In the middle, Jerry, the brown mouse, stands with his eyes closed, confidently holding a cue stick extending from the left side of the screen in his right hand and a billiard chalk in his left. He proudly applies chalk to the tip of the cue stick before casually tossing the chalk behind him. He then positions the cue stick beside the white ball, preparing to take his shot.

A close-up reveals a pool table with a green cover. On the table is Jerry, the brown mouse, who holds a cue stick with both hands. In front of him to the right is the white ball and various balls are arranged to the right of the white ball. He aims the cue stick at the white ball and strikes it. The white ball travels to the right and hits the balls which results in a bright light. Jerry flies back with the cue, holding onto it with his right hand.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A blue ceiling stretches above blue walls, with a yellow door positioned on the left side. In the center, a green pool table dominates the space. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is stuck in the far-right hole of the pool table, with only his head visible as he looks directly at the camera. Pool balls scatter across the table, colliding with each other before dropping into various holes. As the movement settles, a yellow ball with the number one rolls steadily across the table, heading straight toward Tom.
