A dark purple flooring extends across the screen with a green wall to the left which meets a brick wall at the center and extends to the right. There's a brown litterbox and white pillow on it. On the floor is a red bowl with six puppies feeding from it. Tom, the blue-gray cat and Jerry, the brown mouse are watching from opposite sides of the bowl. Suddenly, another white puppy comes from the right side of the screen and joins the others.

A dark grey floor extends across the screen, with a green wooden wall to the left and a red brick wall meeting at the center. A brown carton box with white pillows is positioned at the edge of the green wall. In the center, a group of white puppies eagerly eat from a red bowl. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands nearby watching, while Jerry, the brown mouse, observes from the other side. After a few moments, Tom rests one of his hands on the green wall, while Jerry does the same on the brown carton box.

The clip takes place in an area with a gray floor and a light wood wall. A dark wooden ornament is visible on the top corner of the right frame and stands in front of a brick wall. Centered in the middle frame, slightly to the left, is the blue-gray cat, Tom, standing with their left leg crossed to their right and supporting their body by leaning their left hand against the light wood wall. The brown mouse, Jerry, is visible on the right frame, standing atop a light gray mat with their right hand stretching, supporting their body by holding a yellow box on their right. Seen between Tom and Jerry, are several cubs surrounding a red bowl, burying their heads inside with swaying their heads back and forth. The clip ends with the screen darkened and zooming into the cubs.
