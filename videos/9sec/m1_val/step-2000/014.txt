The scene is set outdoors with an ocean. In the background, on the left side of the frame, a brown mountain is visible and a blue and white cloudy sky. There is also a red surfboard visible in the frame. Jerry, the brown mouse, is the central character, positioned standing on the red surfboard. Jerry, the brown mouse, is actively surfing on the red board on the water, moving forward and surfing while, at the end of the scene, waves rise and splash the camera. The camera is panning forward, following Jerry, the brown mouse, as he moves across the water.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The scene takes place inside a ship with blue-painted walls. There is a round window on the wall, which is open, revealing the blue sky outside. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is wearing a white hat and a blue shirt. As he looks out the window, a wave crashes against his face, soaking him in seawater. He grimaces but then continues peering outside.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Green mountain ranges with blue-violet skies, a lavish beige-painted resort is seen with palm trees around its buildings. Jerry, the brown mouse, wearing yellow shorts  and riding a red surfboard, comes from the middle of the screen, goes through the wavy blue sea, and towards the bay.
