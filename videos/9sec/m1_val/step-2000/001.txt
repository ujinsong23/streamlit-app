A peach floor stretches across the screen against a pale blue wall. A light blue door lies half open at the right. Jerry, the brown mouse, walks into the room from the doorway, swinging his arms, his mouth stretched in a wide grin, and his tail flicking happily. The legs of a lady wearing a blue frock, a frilled white apron, bright orange socks with yellow square patches on the heels, and red slippers are visible on the left of the screen. The lady taps her left foot on the floor. Jerry the brown mouse reaches near the lady's foot and immediately steps back horrified and surprised and sheepishly turns around with his arms behind his back.

The scene shows a room with brown floors set against a light blue wall with a purple open door.  Jerry, the brown mouse, is tiptoeing away from a woman wearing red slippers, a blue dress and a white apron, tapping her feet. Jerry walks to the door and grabs it as he leaves and the screen pans to the right, showing the outside with a blue picket fence, trees and a blue cloudy sky.

The scene is showing the lower half of a wide-open white door with a yellow frame that leads to the outside of the house. The floor is light red, and the wall is blue. A low wooden fence and gate can be seen outdoors. Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing at the doorway with his back to the outside of the house. He is slowly stepping backward, his shoulders shrugged while the door gradually closes on him. The scene fades with an iris-out transition and stops as the door also stops moving. Jerry then smiles a big smile and does a frantic wave with his upper right paw, signaling a goodbye to whoever he is looking at inside the house.
