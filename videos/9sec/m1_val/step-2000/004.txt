The scene is set on a blue pond surrounded by tall, green grass. A gray-white duck is gliding on top of the water, whistling with her eyes closed with a rope tied to her tail. Next to her is a yellow duckling, who turns and returns to Jerry, the brown mouse, who is sitting on an orange floater attached to the duck's tail, arms behind his head, eyes closed, and smirking.

The scene is set in a swampy area with tall green reeds and murky water. An orange inflatable ring floats on the water. At the front, a white and gray duck paddles forward, while the yellow duck is between the white-gray duck and Jerry, the brown mouse. Jerry is seated on the inflatable ring, with a rope attached to the white-gray duck. The gray duck shakes its tail as it moves forward, while the yellow duck circles around Jerry. Jerry lies back on the inflatable ring, feeling relaxed, and then stands up, joyfully blowing a dark yellow flute. His eyes are closed in happiness as he enjoys the moment, while the yellow duck watches Jerry with a curious gaze.

A blue river with big green grasses extends across the screen. Mother duck, the gray duck swimming in the river partially shows its back with its tail tied to a string that pulls an orange floater where Jerry, a brown mouse is sitting relaxed while sipping from a yellow bottle with his left hand. After that, his right arm is stretched shouldering Quacker, the yellow baby duck that also swims in the river. The screen is slowly fading to black only with a circular view of the scene focusing on Jerry and Quacker looking at each other while smiling until it all turned the screen black.
