A big house can be seen far away at the front of the camera. A small pathway stretches from the house to the front of camera. There is a park with a tall tree at the right side of the pathway. There is a stone wall at the left side of the pathway. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in the middle of the pathway facing the house. A gray cat stands beside him. The gray cat takes a graduation cap from the pathway at his right side and put it on Jerry's head. Then he looks at Jerry, the brown mouse, happily. After that he reaches out to Jerry's hand.

A gray pathway leads straight to a house surrounded by a green garden and trees. A gray concrete wall lines the left side of the pathway, with grass around it. Jerry, the brown mouse, wearing a black graduation cap, stands to the left, and a gray kitten stands to his right. Both have their backs to the camera as they smile at each other while holding hands. They do a little jump before starting to walk toward the house in front.

The camera captures a picturesque outdoor setting with a clear blue sky, framed by lush green trees and a charming house in the background. A stone wall lines the pathway, enhancing the idyllic atmosphere. Jerry, the brown mouse, holds hands with a small puppy, happily skipping along the sidewalk. Jerry is to the left, while the puppy trails closely beside him, both radiating joy. Together, they walk majestically, their grip on each otherâ€™s hands emphasizing their friendship. The background curves in a circular formation around them, signifying the scene's conclusion and highlighting their joyful journey together.
