A white rooftop with a striped umbrella is set against a dark blue sky filled with stars and the silhouettes of trees. The white cat, dressed in a red bow, looks down as the camera pans down to a gray dog. He is wearing a sharp choker necklace and playing a harp, looking up at the cat on the rooftop with a smile and his tongue out.

A gray wall stands against a blue sky, setting the scene in an outdoor nighttime environment. To the right, a partially visible brick wall has a green bush covering its base. Spike, the gray dog, gleefully holds a large double bass in one hand, his tongue lolling out in happiness as he glances upward. Using his other hand, he plucks the instrument’s strings—Tom’s tail—which is pinned onto the tuning keys. As the camera moves downward, Tom’s frustrated face is revealed, his whiskers now stretched across the instrument, serving as its strings. His entire body is pulled taut against the double bass. Nearby, Jerry, the brown mouse, stands with a mischievous smile, also looking upward, seemingly enjoying Tom’s predicament.

The screen shows an aerial view of a green lawn in the night against a hedge. There is a guitar on the grass with Tom, the blue-gray cat, on top. His whiskers are stuck to the guitar, and he has his head in his right palm with one eye open. Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing on top of the guitar, dancing and smiling as Tom stares. Jerry strums Tom's whiskers while his body shakes. Spike, the gray dog feet are only visible.
