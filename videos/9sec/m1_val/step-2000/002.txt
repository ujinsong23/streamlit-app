A light green field, is set against the backdrop of a yellow and brown house off in the distance on the left and part of a light gray sky on the right. A light gray tombstone marks an open grave front and center.  In the grave, clasping one yellow 5 petaled flower, is Tom, the blue-gray cat.  His eyes are closed, teeth gritted and chattering as he shakes all over lying in the grave.  He abruptly stops shaking, sits up and opens his eyes and looks at something to his right off screen, eyes and whiskers at full attention in curiosity.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The ground is brown, extending to a grey sidewalk on the right with a white picket fence, green tree leaves, red fire hydrant on the right. The main background is blue sky with white clouds. The camera pans to the left, following a red truck, with a dog catcher sign on the side and the gray dog, Spike in the back behind yellow bars. The camera pans further left, revealing yellow buildings and a green lamppost to the left. The brown mouse, Jerry enters from the right, with a concerned look, reaching towards Spike, running after the truck. The blue-gray cat, Tom then enters the scene on all fours with an angry expression, chasing Jerry.

A dirt road stretches across the screen beneath a clear blue sky. To the left, a yellow building lines the roadside. In the center, a red truck carrying a caged animal in its bed drives away from the camera. Jerry, the brown mouse, runs and hops after it, while Tom, the blue-gray cat, sprints after Jerry, the brown mouse bounding down the dirt road.
