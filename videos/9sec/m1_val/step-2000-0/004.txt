There is a brown floor, set against a brown wall with a mouse hole in it. Outside the hole is a set brown and silver mousetrap, on it is a piece of cheese wrapped like a present with ribbon on it. Jerry, the brown mouse is lunging out of of the mouse hole, with a candy cane in his arms. With a frown and concentrated face, Jerry reaches the candy cane out and loops it into the hole of the bow in the ribbon, and grabs the cheese. He pulls the cheese towards himself, now with a smile on his face. The mousetrap then clicks and is about to be set off, and Jerry's eyebrows go up, and his mouth opens.

A smooth brown floor stretches across the screen, set against a wooden wall with a baseboard. In the center of the wall, a mouse hole is visible, while to the left, a metal furnace stands against the wooden wall. In front of the mouse hole, a wooden mousetrap with a metal lever is set. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands between the trap and the mouse hole, holding a candy cane with a chunk of cheese tied to its curve with a red ribbon. As the metal lever moves toward him, he glances at the trap before turning to the camera with a bright-eyed smile.

A brown wall with shadows of a plant, extends behind a dark wood piece of furniture to the left of the frame, the baseboard has a mouse hole in it over a polished brown floor. The hole has a sprung mouse trap with roses painted on the base. The mouse trap spring moves slowly toward Jerry, the brown mouse, who is holding a piece of cheese with a ribbon around it, hooked to a candy cane. He looks to the camera, and then to the slowly moving trap spring with a wide-eyed smile on his face.
