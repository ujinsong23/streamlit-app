There is a wooden desk with a white paper titled "Score Sheet" with 9 x's on it within checkboxes used for bowling scoring in front of a light pink wall. The camera pans right following Jerry, the brown mouse, walking along the desk. Jerry closes his eyes, happily strutting along the wood carrying a yellow pencil with salmon colored eraser and a black tip.

White walls stretch across the background of the scene. A brown wooden table with a white calendar showing a box grid with black Xs in it, sits in front of the wall. The camera pans slightly right and zooms in, as Jerry, the brown mouse, walks across the brown table, carrying a yellow marker with a black tip and a red end. Jerry walks to the edge of the table and writes another X on the white calendar with the marker, smiling.

In a room with a purple wall and a blue curtain in the background, a wooden calendar holder rests in the foreground. A white calendar page is attached to the wooden holder with a metal screw with torn white paper around the edges. Many of the dates have been marked with a black X. On top of the calendar holder, Jerry, the brown mouse, holds a yellow pen with a black tip and red band around the top with both hands. He swings and tosses the pen, red end first, out of view before turning, dusting his hands against each other, and grinning.
