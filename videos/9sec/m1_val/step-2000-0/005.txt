A smooth brown floor stretches across the screen, set against a wooden wall with a baseboard. In the center of the wall, a mouse hole is visible, while to the left, a metal furnace stands against the wooden wall. In front of the mouse hole, a wooden mousetrap with a metal lever is set. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands between the trap and the mouse hole, holding a candy cane with a chunk of cheese tied to its curve with a red ribbon. As the metal lever moves toward him, he glances at the trap before turning to the camera with a bright-eyed smile.

A brown wall with shadows of a plant, extends behind a dark wood piece of furniture to the left of the frame, the baseboard has a mouse hole in it over a polished brown floor. The hole has a sprung mouse trap with roses painted on the base. The mouse trap spring moves slowly toward Jerry, the brown mouse, who is holding a piece of cheese with a ribbon around it, hooked to a candy cane. He looks to the camera, and then to the slowly moving trap spring with a wide-eyed smile on his face.

A dimly lit corner with dark flooring, a tan wall, and a mouse hole is visible. A yellow mousetrap with a spring sits on the floor. Jerry, the brown mouse stands by the trap near the mouse hole and holds a candy cane tied to a piece of cheese with red string in his arms. He watches as the spring of the trap lowers down slowly next to him. Jerry looks directly at the camera with a big smile and a wide open mouth and blinks.
