A dirt floor stretches across the screen, set against a light blue wall. A white hen sits on a yellow nest with chickens around it holding brown flowers raised in her left wing and looking to the right. Jerry, the brown mouse sits on the yellow nest in front of the white hen with eyes closed. The white hen, and the chickens, make body reactions. Jerry, the brown mouse opens its eyes, looks up, and closes them.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A strip of gray wall shows behind a fat white chicken sitting in a nest of yellow straw that stretches across the scene. Four yellow chicks sleep around the white chicken as she visibly breathes in and out. Jerry, the brown mouse, reclines against the chicken's chest with two yellow chicks on either side of him. Jerry's arms are behind his head, his legs are spread out, and his eyes are closed. Jerry speaks and stretches, then relaxes against the chicken's chest again again.

A bed of straw covers the foreground of the screen, with a white hen resting on top. Four little yellow chicks sleep nestled against her feathers. In the center of the henâ€™s feathers, Jerry, the brown mouse, reclines comfortably with his arms tucked behind his head and his eyes closed. After a moment, he shrugs, then glances to his right, looking down at the hen's feathers. Turning back, he begins poking the hen repeatedly.
