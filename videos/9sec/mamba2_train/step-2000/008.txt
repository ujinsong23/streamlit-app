The top of a billiards table stretches across the screen, set against a gradient of soft blue and purple wall. Water sprays upward from two red holes, creating tall splashes. Tomâ€™s hand, the only visible part of the blue-gray cat, covers one of the holes with a clenched fist. The camera pans slightly to the right as another burst of water sprays from a different hole. As it continues panning, the corner hole comes into view, and another spray shoots up, lifting Jerry, the brown mouse, into the air. At its maximum height, Jerry sits atop the water stream.

A gray wall meets a gray floor and in the room, the corner of a pool table is visible with a stream of water blasting out of the corner pocket. Jerry, the brown mouse, is on the peak of the water in a sitting position with his hands by his sides and his eyes closed. As the water splashes Jerry up and down, Tom runs in with a stick in his left hand, takes a beat and sticks his tongue out in excitement and then swings at Jerry but misses and hits the water stream instead.

A green billiard table with a wooden frame sits in the foreground. A red pocket in the right corner gushes water in a fountain-like stream. The background consists of a plain light purple wall and a purple floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, is perched at the top of the water stream with his hands above his head and eyes closed. Tom, the blue-gray cat, looks at Jerry with wide eyes, mouth open, and tongue out. He leans slightly backward while gripping a brown cue with his raised hand. His right leg is forward, and his left leg is backward. Tom swings the cue to the left, missing Jerry the first time, then sways it back to the right, moving his body with the motion. His tail points upward as he successfully knocks Jerry out of the fountain. Tom then stares at the top of the fountain with wide eyes, realizing Jerry is gone.
