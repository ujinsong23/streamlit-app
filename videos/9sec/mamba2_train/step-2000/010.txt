With a warm glow from the moon illuminating the surroundings. The entrance of a barn is visible, framed by wooden beams. Spike, the gray bulldog, sits calmly at the forefront with a red collar adorned with spikes. His expression is one of annoyance. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is hanging upside-down from the roof or entrance of the barn. Tom playfully mocks Spike, and his anger intensifies, prompting him to rush out of the barn in a fit of fury.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The scene takes place outdoors at night, with a dark blue sky. A gray fence runs across the background, with a tree standing in the left corner and grass growing at the base of the wall. On the right, there is a white doghouse with a red roof, labeled "KILLER." Spike, the gray dog, is inside the doghouse, looking furious. He raises both hands and growls before crawling out, standing up with wide, angry eyes. The camera slowly zooms out as Spike scans his surroundings. On the roof of the doghouse, Tom, the blue-gray cat, is lying down, resting his chin on his hand. He has a mischievous grin, holding a coiled yellow rope in his left hand. With his right hand, he grips an orange pan, ready to strike Spike. In the bottom right corner of the frame, a brown guitar leans against the doghouse.

The scene depicts a grassy backyard at night, with a dark blue sky speckled with stars. In the center, there is a red and white doghouse with a sign that reads "KILLER." Tom, the blue-gray cat, is perched on the doghouse roof, holding a small hammer. Below him, Spike, the muscular gray dog, looks up with a suspicious expression. Tom strikes Spike on the head with the hammer, causing the dog to tremble and momentarily stiffen. Then, Tom quickly unrolls a rope and tries to tie up Spike, who is still dazed from the hit.
