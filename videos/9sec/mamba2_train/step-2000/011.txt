The scene is a dumpster area, closed off by a high wooden green fence. Behind the green fence is the brick wall of a building. In the foreground are three cylindrical waste bins, the third at the leftmost only partially visible. Butch, the black and gray alley cat, is just behind the trash bins. He is holding on his left hand the cover of one of the bins, inner side up with food scraps on it. He lifts the cover of the other bin using his right hand and looks inside the bin. He brings his face close to the open bin and smells its contents. He slams the cover back and shakes his head. He shrinks and looks dizzy, presumably from the smell of the contents of the bin.

A light blue wooden fence spans the screen, set in front of a cream wall. In front of the fence is Butch, the black cat, holding an upside lid of a bin filled with fruits with his left arm. In front of Butch are three bins, and Butch is using his right hand to hold on to the lid of the second bin that is closed. He shakes his head and moves to the left, as the camera pans to the left too.

A dirt ground stretches beneath a beige brick wall, with a small window partially visible. On the right, a wooden vertical fence is partially visible. In the foreground, three metal trash cans are scattered. The one on the left has an open lid, the middle one is closed, and the rightmost can, partially visible, has an open lid filled with discarded food and waste. A black cat stands near the left trash can, holding it with one hand while gripping the lid with discarded trash in the other. With a pleasant expression, he looks inside, shakes the can, then gestures as if about to reach inside.
