Tom playing the guitar and enjoying the moment then someone throws a cake all over his face

The scene is dark outdoors. Leaves from a tree can be seen at the upper left corner, and far behind is a partially visible fence. Tom, the blue-gray cat, is in the middle, his face and head fully covered in a white, creamy substance with several pieces of red-colored fruits. Tom shakes his head left and right vigorously to remove the cream, and the cream and fruits fly off in all directions to reveal Tom's face.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A kitchen shelf spans across the screen, with a yellow pan hanging on the wall beside it. An open window reveals a night view of trees and a white gate. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the window and looks outside to the left, then jumps in shock. He quickly runs inside the house, and Tom, the blue-gray cat, jumps from outside to the window, chasing him inside.
