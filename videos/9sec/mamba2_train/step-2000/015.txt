A green cabinet stands against the wall, featuring a square mirror in the center and an extended ledge in front holding a slightly flattened blue toothpaste. Beneath the extension, three toothbrushes—blue, light blue, and yellow—hang neatly in a row. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands in front of the mirror, facing right, wearing white joke glasses with a spiral motif. He holds a small gray rat with a white mustache, dressed in a black hat with blue stripes, with both hands. Suddenly, Jerry, the brown mouse, leaps in from the right, yanking the mustached rat away, revealing that he wears a red scarf, blue boots, and carries a yellow guitar in his left hand. Jerry dashes midair to the right, clutching the mustached rat tightly before vanishing from view. Tom then removes his joke glasses and glares to the right with an annoyed expression.<end_scene>

<start_scene>The scene features a close-up of a purple floor extending beneath a yellow structure on the left and a yellow door. The doorway leads to another space with soft blue-tinted walls. As the camera pans right, Jerry, the brown mouse, energetically hops into view, carrying a tiny black-hatted character playing a yellow guitar. The small figure, dressed in purple shoes, has a long, prominent white beard extending from its face and strums the guitar while being carried by Jerry.

A scene with a pale purple floor and a wooden table leg slightly visible at the top is displayed on the screen. Jerry, the brown mouse, is seen running to the left carrying a white-moustached gray mouse wearing a black cowboy hat, cowboy boots, and holding a yellow guitar. The camera pans to the left following Jerry as he carries the gray mouse in both hands over the wooden table leg until they reach a gold-framed floor vent, where they fall into one of the vents. Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears running from the right, then turns around to be in front of the vent.
