A light purple wall and door on the right stretch across the screen. Tom, the blue gray cat is standing tall in the middle with a yellow piece of paper in both his hands out in front of him. As he reads the paper he moves back and stares at the camera with his eyes and mouth wide open. He blinks a few times before looking back at the paper with a scrunched up face, places it in one hand and prepares to march off towards the closed door.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A set of ornate, white doors is slightly off-center in the shot. A red carpet protrudes from the doors, and a small green tree sprouts from a blue pot on the left-hand side. The doors open to reveal Tom, the blue-gray cat, dressed in a small black top hat, a white bib with a red tie, and beige ankle cuffs. Tom happily struts forward with a brown cane and his eyes closed.

A blue wall stretches across the back of the scene behind a set of open white doors with a red carpet running between the doors, and a blue pot with a green and brown plant next to it. Tom, the blue-gray cat, wearing a black hat, and smoking a brown cigar, walks up the carpet with a brown cane. Tom cringes forward, and turns as the camera pans to the right, revealing a small mousehole in the wall with a green awning over it and two blue pots on either side of the hole, with green plants in them. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in the entrance to the hole.
