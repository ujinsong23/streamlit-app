A Christmas tree hangs over a brown floor with purple and brass ornaments, blue and gold beads, a yellow giraffe and a pink elephant. The camera pans right following Jerry, the brown mouse, as he runs past more ornaments, a toy car, a stuffed bear, metal top, stacking letter blocks and a pink gift wrapped with a red bow. Jerry, the brown mouse, skids to a halt by the pink gift, in front of a purple gift with purple bow, spying a sprig of mistletoe threaded through the red ribbon. He jumps up to retrieve the mistletoe from the package.

A decorated Christmas tree is shown in the background next to a stack of wooden blocks on the left. A white-wrapped box is shown in the foreground with a label on the side and red ribbon crossed in the front holding a sprig of a flowering white plant. Jerry, the brown mouse, removes the sprig from the ribbon and huddles under it as Tom, the blue-gray cat, leaps into the frame with extended claws and an open mouth. Upon seeing Jerry underneath the flower Tom pauses, sits, closes his mouth, and looks at Jerry.<end_scene>

<start_scene>In a room with blue walls, a white box with an orange ribbon is shown. In front of the box, Jerry, the brown mouse, holds a leafy flower with small blooms above his head with his right hand. He breathes heavily and then smiles, pointing up with his left hand.
