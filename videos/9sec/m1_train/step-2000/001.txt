A swimming pool with a brown edge spans the screen, with a green lawn with bushes visible in the background.  Inside the pool is a black cat that is submerged in the water bar it head. On its head is Jerry, the brown mouse, resting upside down. Jerry is wearing a pair of yellow pants. The black cat looks to the left and tries to tilt the eyes to see Jerry on the head but it is impossible. The cat swings its head up and down, which sends Jerry rotating the air before turning right. After a few rotations, Jerry lands on the nose of the black, who can now see Jerry.

Green ground stretches across the scene. There is half round pool with wide pool edge at the left side of the scene. There is a black seagull in the pool whose head is above the pool's surface. Jerry, the brown mouse, with yellow shorts, stands on the seagull's snout. They look at each other. Suddenly Jerry, the brown mouse, runs away fast. The black seagull gets out from the pool and catches him back. The seagull is back to the pool with his upper half body is above the pool's surface, facing right and Jerry, the brown mouse, sits on his snout, facing right too.

The scene shows a pool surrounded by brown stones against a green lawn.  Jerry, the brown mouse, is sitting on the stone wearing a yellow short, looking at a black seal who is in the water, blowing at the sides .
