The sky is blue-green with leaves of trees seen art the left side of the screen. Below it is a beige wall with brown bricks on top. The exterior of a yellow house is seen with window frames in white. At the left side of the window is an device shaped like a box in red-brown color with a yellow-green meter at its left. Below the house are green bushes. Tom, the blue-gray cat stands in the middle of the screen, holding an open orange book by both hands, shakes his head, looks at the book with eyes getting small, then looks at the back, leftwards.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A white wooden wall extends across the screen. Beside the wall, four cats stand, colored brown, dark brown, black, and grey, respectively. The black cat is holding a book, and the cats are laughing loudly as they read it. Tom’s paws appear from the other side of the wall, followed by his head, as he peeks curiously, seemingly drawn in by the cats' laughter.

The scene takes place outdoors under a bright blue sky. A long white fence stretches across the frame from left to right, with two large green trees standing outside the fence on both sides. In the center, two round gray trash cans sit side by side. Four cats, from left to right—yellow, brown, black, and gray—are gathered around them. The small yellow cat sits atop one trash can, while the black cat stands inside the other. All four burst into laughter as they read a yellow book held by the black cat. Outside the fence, Tom, the blue-gray cat, peeks in, watching the scene unfold.
