A room with a yellow wall, white baseboard, and black floor is shown. A mousehole is centered in the white baseboard. On the left side of the frame, a hand pulls the tail of Tom, the blue-gray cat. Tom is slid across the frame to the left, lying on the wooden floor with spiked fur and his chin resting in his left palm. Dust is visible trailing Tom as he stares ahead with furrowed eyebrows and an annoyed expression. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out of the mousehole with a smile as Tom passes.

A dark wood floor stretches across the screen, set against a tan wall with a white baseboard. In the center of the baseboard, a mouse hole is visible. Jerry, the brown mouse, peeks out of the mouse hole, watching as a partially visible Tom, the blue-gray cat, darts off-screen, leaving a cloud of dust behind. Once Tom disappears, Jerry looks after him in the distance and waves his right hand with a delighted expression.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A black floor stretches across the screen in front of a cream-colored wall with white trim and a mousehole in it. Jerry, the brown mouse, excitedly looks out of the mousehole to the left of the scene with his ears perked up, and his eyes and mouth wide open. He steps out, faces to the left of the scene, and then closes his eyes, and brings his arms to his waist. He brings his body forward and sticks his tongue out, then pulls back and faces the camera before smiling widely with his mouth open.
