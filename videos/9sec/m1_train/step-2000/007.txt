The floor is brown, extending to a blue wall with yellow curtains on the left and a pale orange arm chair with brown trim on the right. The center has a brown table with a glass fishbowl and white flowers with a yellow center on the right. The blue-gray cat, Tom is sitting cat like, on the table, with an open mouthed smile, staring at the brown mouse, Jerry who is inside the fishbowl. The brown mouse, Jerry has his eyes closed in effort, and tries to run up the side of the fishbowl, managing to grab the rim with both hands.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A pale-yellowish pink wall is set behind the top of a round, clear glass fishbowl.  Jerry, the brown mouse, is clinging to the edge, struggling to climb out from the inside of the fishbowl.  As he swings one leg up over the edge, Tom, the blue-gray cat, appears from the left side of the screen, yellow eyes and smiling mouth wide with glee, as he reaches over the top of the bowl with one white paw claws extended.  Jerry gets his balance on the edge of the fishbowl, just as Tom's paw flicks him from the front and sends him tumbling back down into the bowl.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A round glass fishbowl sits on a small, round table next to a loose, lightly colored flower. An orange-striped armchair sits in the background to the right of the table, across the room from large, golden curtains. The blue-gray cat, Tom, circles his left claw over the fishbowl, peering inside with a smile. Inside the fishbowl, the brown mouse, Jerry, stumbles. Jerry starts up a sprint and runs up the walls of the fishbowl, jumping and grabbing the rim before pulling himself halfway up. Tom pulls his claws back and looks amazed as he watches Jerry pull himself up.
