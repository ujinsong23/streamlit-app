A gray floor spans the screen, set against a wooden green wall with a dome-shaped opening at the bottom and a green window to the left. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands in front of the wall. He then points to the left  with his right arm while looking at the camera. He then raises the left leg and arm  as he yawns before bringing them down.<end_scene>

<start_scene>A huge ocean extends across the screen. We can see a couple of hills in the background and a small island in the distance. There's a road connecting to the island. In the front of the screen, there's a balcony of a building with trees seen on the edge. Standing on the balcony are Tom, the blue-grat cat, Jerry, the brown mouse, and a small mouse wearing a red scarf. The small mouse is seen pointing to the island. Tom and Jerry are listening attentively. As the video comes to an end, Tom seems to be slipping closer.

The scene features a vast blue sea, stretching toward the horizon. In the center, an island rises with lush green trees and distant mountains under a bright blue sky dotted with fluffy white clouds. A tall tree stands on the right side, while leaves and branches extend from the upper left. A stone floor leads to a sturdy baluster railing overlooking the sea. Tom, the blue-gray cat, happily rests his paws on the baluster. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands beside him, gazing at the island. A gray mouse excitedly points toward the island while talking cheerfully to Tom and Jerry.
