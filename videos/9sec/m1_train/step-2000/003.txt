The background is a blue-green sky, by the beach, with the silhouette of trees and bushes at the far left, and the body of a tree with leaves below more visibly seen same at the left. Tom, the blue-gray cat, stands on light brown sand and wears red shorts tied with a string at his waist. With a peeled coconut on his hands, he smashes it onto the big gray rock in front of him, but the coconut bounces back and hits his face, covering it entirely. At the upper red side are leaves of a tree.

A beach covered in brown sand stretches across the screen, with blue water in the background and a giant coconut leaves on the left side. A black rock sits on the right side of the screen. Tom, the blue-gray cat, wears red pants and stands with a brown coconut covering his face. He looks to the right, then to the center, blinking through the coconut's holes. He shakes his head, causing the coconut to fall and reveal his face. Then, he looks down at the rock on the right side.<end_scene>

<start_scene>There is a beach sand and a tiny part of water spread under a clear blue sky with a cloud on the scene. There are also coconut leaves visible on the left and lower part of the scene, as well as a coconut tree on the right. In the lower left part, a green turtle is slowly walking to the right with a tired face. The camera is moving to the right, following him, and then stopping. Tom, the blue-gray cat, then appeared running from the left with his excited face and an open mouth to try to go on the turtle's way. Tom is wearing red shorts with white lace. His hands are on the right.
