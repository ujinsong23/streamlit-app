The scene is set on a verandah or outdoor space. The floor is smooth and yellow-tinted, resembling tile or polished wood. The background wall is blue-gray, suggesting the exterior of a house. Tom, the blue-gray cat, and a small, gray puppy enter the frame from the right, moving in reverse, with a concerned and worried expression. His ears are slightly back and his eyes are wide open. He is covered in mud, with patches on his head, shoulder, and back. Tom holds a small, gray puppy in his hands, which he gently puts on the floor, extending both paws forward. He then leans forward to inspect the puppy with interest. The puppy remains motionless lying on its stomach and looking up at Tom innocently.

A brown floor spans across with a gray wall at the back divided in rectangles. Tom the blue-gray cat stands leaning forward with brown mud on his forehead, shoulder and back. A small gray dog resembling spike lies on the brown floor. Tom wipes mud from his head with his left hand and accidentally throws it on the dog's face then jumps up in shock looking at the dog as the dog stares back at him.

A wide, brown floor stretches across the screen, set against a layered and textured gray colored wall. Tom, the blue-gray cat is standing shakenly and his eyes are wide open in a shocked expression while looking at a flat lying light gray dog with a red and gold collar. The blue-gray cat Tom drops the mop and trembles with shock in one place, turns to the left and grabs a green towel and turns back to the dog and covers and cleans it quickly and immediately turns to the left again and grabs a broom which he holds high over the dog with his right hand.
