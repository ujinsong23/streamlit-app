A wooden interior features dark brown walls and flooring, with a wooden shelf mounted on the upper left side holding small objects. Two oval-framed pictures hang on the right wall, and a dark brown circular rug partially covers the floor.  In the center, two small dark green chairs with armrests face the viewer. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands near the left chair, while a yellow bird sits in the right chair. Jerry first extends his left arm and points to the left with a serious expression. He then widens his mouth, pulling it apart with both hands to reveal his full set of teeth while narrowing his eyes. Then, he grabs both of his ears and pulls them upward. Finally, Jerry extends his arms outward and flaps them like a bird. The yellow bird remains seated with its head resting on one hand. It watches Jerry with a calm expression.

The room has wooden walls and a dark floor with an oval rug in the center. There are two small green chairs, a shelf in the background with some objects and round pictures hanging on the wall.  Jerry, the brown mouse, is standing next to one of the chairs. Canary, a small yellow bird, is sitting on the other chair.  The brown mouse, Jerry, tries to scare with his raised paws and a fierce expression, while the yellow bird, sitting on the chair, smiles calmly. Then Jerry is surprised, watching the bird laugh and lean back.

A brown wooden wall spans the screen, revealing shelves to the left. On the shelves is a gray plate and a black jar. On the wall to the right hang two framed round pictures of ducks. Seated on a green wooden chair to the right is Quacker, a yellow duck. To the left of Quacker is Jerry, the brown mouse, who is standing in front of a green wooden chair. Quacker is laughing and facing down while Jerry has placed his hands on the head. He leans back and opens his mouth and eyes wide open before taking a step towards Quacker and grabbing him. He shakes Quacker for a period, who now looks at him and then uses both his hands to point to the left.
