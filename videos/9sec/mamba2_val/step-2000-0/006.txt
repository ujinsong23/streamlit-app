A dark green room stretches across the left side of the room with the leg of a table visible in the left. On the right is a lighter green room with a chair. Tom, the blue gray cat pops his head around the corner with a smirk on his face. He disappears behind the wall and returns crouched down on the floor flattening his body. He slides down around the corner heading towards the table legs and reaches out his arms to touch it.

A dark floor stretches across the scene with a dark wall behind it and a wooden table in front of it, with an opening to a green room off to the side. Tom, the blue-gray cat, mischievously snakes his elongated body around the wall's opening with furrowed brows and a smile. His back legs walk around the opening and condense back into his body, to where he assumes a pouncing position. The camera pans left as he starts carefully crawling onto the table's box stretcher.

A wide, black floor stretches across the scene with a green wall and a dark wooden table. Tom, the blue-gray cat, intently lays on the table's box stretcher with heavily furrowed brows and his mouth tightly shut. The camera pans left as Tom carefully crawls on the box stretcher. He stands up on the hill of the stretcher, raises his arms to the side, and then slides down to the other foot of the table as he flails his arms in the air. He grabs onto the leg of the table.
