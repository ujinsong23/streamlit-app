A light-colored floor stretches across the screen against a tan wall with a white baseboard and a pink curtain on the right. To the left, a green-backed wooden chair is partially visible. In the center, Jerry, the brown mouse, stands looking up with a happy expression at Toots, the yellow cat. Toots wears a red-orange hair bow and a matching bow around her neck as she stands beside the green-backed chair, gazing down at Jerry. As Jerry reaches up, grabs Tootsâ€™ face, and kisses her on the mouth, she closes her blue-shadowed eyelids. When he pulls away, she covers her mouth with her paw. Meanwhile, Jerry leaps into the air, waving his feet back and forth in excitement, grinning with joy.<end_scene>
