A strip of gray wall shows behind a fat white chicken sitting in a nest of yellow straw that stretches across the scene. Four yellow chicks sleep around the white chicken as she visibly breathes in and out. Jerry, the brown mouse, reclines against the chicken's chest with two yellow chicks on either side of him. Jerry's arms are behind his head, his legs are spread out, and his eyes are closed. Jerry speaks and stretches, then relaxes against the chicken's chest again again.

A bed of straw covers the foreground of the screen, with a white hen resting on top. Four little yellow chicks sleep nestled against her feathers. In the center of the henâ€™s feathers, Jerry, the brown mouse, reclines comfortably with his arms tucked behind his head and his eyes closed. After a moment, he shrugs, then glances to his right, looking down at the hen's feathers. Turning back, he begins poking the hen repeatedly.

A nest of light brown hay sits beneath a large, white hen, which is partially visible. Several small, yellow chicks sleep nestled in the hay against the white feathers of the hen as it breathes in and out. Jerry the brown mouse, is sitting in front of the hen, turned toward it. Jerry fluffs up the feathers of the hen and then presses himself back into them, clasping his fingers together in front of him and laying back with his legs out. He closes his eyes with a big smile.
