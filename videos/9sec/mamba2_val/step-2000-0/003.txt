Underneath a white cabinet, a yellow block of cheese sits on the dark hardwood floor. Jerry, the brown mouse, sits on top of the cheese, closing his eyes and covering his ears with his hands. He looks to the side and lowers his hands. smiling, before whistling with closed eyes.

A blue wall with light blue bedframe sits atop a brown floor. Jerry, the brown mouse sits on top of a large chunk of yellow cheese with holes in it. Jerry, the brown mouse rests his right hand on the cheese, his right leg is crossed over his left, eyes are wide open and mouth is open in a vertical oval. Jerry, the brown mouse closes his eyes, reaches out his left hand and rips a chunk of cheese off of the top left corner, opens his mouth wide and eats the entire large chunk whole. He licks his finger as he pulls his finger out and chews in satisfaction.

A dark brown floor stretches across the screen, with a light blue wall in the background. In front of the wall, the white legs of a piece of furniture are visible. Beneath the furniture, a piece of cheese rests on the floor, with Jerry, the brown mouse, sitting on top. His eyes are wide, and his legs are crossed as he casually chews. He then winks at the camera as the screen gradually fades to black around him.
