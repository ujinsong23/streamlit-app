A dark brown carpeted floor stretches across the screen, set against a tan wall with pink molding that has a large mousehole in the center of it. Jerry, the brown mouse, stands on the left grimacing with his eyes shut as he pulls a large sign reading "Home Sweet Home" in a wooden frame with legs. Jerry, the brown mouse moves the sign rightwards until its legs are positioned on either side of the mousehole. before scurrying away to the left with a pleased expression.

A black floor spans the screen, with a small mouse hole in the middle of the screen beneath a brown wooden easel that reads, "Home Sweet Home" in blue letters, surrounded by six pink flowers with green stems. To the left of the mouse hole is Jerry, the brown mouse, with his back to the camera and hands on his hips. After seeing the sign, he turns around with a triumphant movement, eyes going from wide open to closed, giving a head nod full of excitement and relief.

A blue "HOME SWEET HOME" wooden sign with a pink flower border leans against a yellow wall with a white baseboard. Centered under the sign is a dark mousehole. Jerry, the brown mouse, smiles at the camera before turning towards the mousehole and marching into it with large steps, his body swaying from side to side.
