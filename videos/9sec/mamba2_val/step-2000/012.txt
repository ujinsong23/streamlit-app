A lawn spans the screen, set against a blue fence. Spike, the gray dog, and Tyke, the gray dog, are sleeping on their stomachs in the field. They are both wearing a red collar with yellow spikes. Jerry, the brown mouse, is between the heads of the dogs and leans towards Tyke. Jerry waves his hand in front of Tykes face to check if Tyke is sleeping before turning back to Spike and pulling a white paper written 'DO NOT DISTURB' from underneath Spike. Jerry then turns the paper so that the message faces him.

A grass field is spread across the screen set against a white fence. On the grass, there is Spike, the gray dog, and a small gray dog ​​next to Spike, both of whom are sleeping. Jerry, the brown mouse, who is between Spike and the gray dog, is holding a white paper with 'DO NOT DISTURB' written on it in red and hanging it on Spike, the gray dog's left ear. After making sure the paper is successfully hung, Jerry, the brown mouse, is getting ready to sleep between Spike and the gray dog.

The scene is on the flat green grass in the yard. A wooden fence is in the background. A leafy plant is partially visible on the right side. On the left side, Spike, the gray bulldog, is sleeping with a slight smile on his face. He is facing center towards the right. Next to Spike, on his left side, is Jerry, the brown mouse, who eases himself in, breathes deeply, and lies down to sleep. Next to Jerry, on his left, is Tyke, the gray bulldog puppy. Spike and Tyke are both wearing identical spiked red dog collars. On Spike's left ear hangs a note that says "DO NOT DISTURB."
