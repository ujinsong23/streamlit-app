Inside the mouse hole, the wall is painted light blue and the floor is made of wood with a clear grain pattern. A small framed picture of a flower hangs on the wall, and a bed covered with a yellow blanket is placed against the left wall. The camera pans from the left side toward the right, showing the entrance of the mouse hole and the path leading to the bed. Jerry, the brown mouse, appears at the doorway and walks slowly toward the bed with a visibly tired expression.

Inside the mouse hole, a light blue wall and a wooden floor establish the space. Against the left wall, a bed covered with a yellow blanket is positioned, and a small framed picture of a flower hangs on the wall above. The camera moves slowly to the left as Jerry, the brown mouse, approaches the bed. A previously unseen small bedside table with a lamp becomes visible next to the bed. Jerry, the brown mouse, climbs up onto the bed, and settles beneath the yellow blanket, opening his mouth with a large yawn.

Inside the mouse hole, the light blue wall and the wooden floor remain the dominant visual elements of the room. A bed covered with a yellow blanket is centrally located, and a small bedside table with a lamp sits next to the bed. Jerry, the brown mouse, lies on the bed, and reaches out to switch off the lamp on the bedside table, causing the illumination in the room to decrease. Jerry, the brown mouse, then closes his eyes and falls asleep.
